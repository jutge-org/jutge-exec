# This script runs the run command in the current directory as nobody.
# Eg: > sudo jutge-somhi 
#
# First, the directory ownership is transfered to nobody.
# Afterwards, all symlinks  removed.
# Then, the run command is executed inside the directory, ran by nobody
# with only a few environment variables, and under some ulimits and timeouts set.
# Again, all symlinks are removed.
# Finally, the directory ownership is transfered back to the original user
# with -rwX------ permissions.
#
# This script should be installed at /usr/local/bin/jutge-somhi
# with -rwx------ 1 root root permissions.
# Use visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/worker to allow worker user to use adding this line:
# worker ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/jutge-somhi

# user:group who originally owns the directory
owner=`stat -c "%U:%G" .`

# PATH that will be set 
newpath="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"

# ulimits
maxoutput=1000000
maxtime=60
maxprocs=1000

# timeout
timeout=25

# change directory ownership to nobody
chown --recursive nobody:nogroup .

# remove all symlinks

# launch run 
su --shell /bin/bash nobody --command "ulimit -c 0 -f $maxoutput -t $maxtime -u $maxprocs && env --ignore-environment PATH=\"$newpath\" LANG=C.UTF-8 USER=nobody timeout $timeout ./run"

# Make sure there are no processes from nobody running.

# remove all special files

# change directory ownership back to original user
